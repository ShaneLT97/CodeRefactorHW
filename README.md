#Search Engine Optimization

The search engine optimization href link in the header wasn't properly redirecting towards the bottom of the page like it's counterparts as it was missing a class, fixed the link now to when clicking Search Engine Optimization it redirects to the bottom of the page to its respective section.




##Content Class

The classes within the content class in the HTML all have the same attributes but were all named differently thus causing more CSS code than neceseccary , renamed all the classes to topBar removed 6 css entries and put all the properties in the .topBar class.




###All Benefits

Within the benefits class in the HTML all the nested classes shared all the same attributes but were named differently , renamed the classes to allBenefits and moved the CSS properties to it's respective allBenefits class and removed 6 css entries.
